## What we do in Talk Matter Conference type Panel Discussion?
* It's a mini conference including two sessions which are mutually connected with one subject.
* The first session consists of invited 2~3 speakers' presentations.
* The other is an open discussion with speakers and prepared questions. Immediate questions are always welcome.

### Role & Responsibility
* Host
  * Choose topics and recruit appropriate speakers at least 2 weeks before.
  * Prepare questions in advance to hold the open discuss session.
  * Introduce speakers for the topic and facilitate the discussion.
  * Manage speech time for speakers and open the topic to audience later for the further discussion.

  * Answer to 2 kinds of questions. One is that the host asked in advance and the other is audience asks for.
* Participants (Audience)
