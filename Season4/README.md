### Extra Agenda
* [Season4 Preparation Meeting 1](./Preparation%20Meeting%201%202020%2012%2017.md)<2020-12-17>

### Goal
* Sustainable and Predictable Schedule management
  * All the host will have responsibility to
    * participate the "Talk Matter" like "officers in Toastmasters" to make decision for the future.
    * participate the retrospective meeting for the future improvement.(maybe every 10 weeks when new season start)
    * assign themselves to the date in schedule of the Talk matters where they want to run the show periodically.
    * collect the news and featured topics or any materials that will be used in the show
    * lead the team(reporters and session masters) of show and have fun while conducting the show.
  * Provide the digital schedule panel that are visible to all participants so that guest and other participants can make schedule to join the show in advance (need technical assistant)
  * in 1 turn of Talk Matters, all the host will run their show 1 time with one slot for "volunteered New Host" the future candidate of the show.
    * so if we have 3 host in this season, "A, B, C, VNH(volunteered new host)" will be 1 turn

* More flexible Topic and format of show based on the focuses what Host are good at
  * Basically, the host can use the original format of the show (news briefing domestic, world news, and featured topic) but if they want, they can apply changes to their own time.

* Expandable platform for more people 
  * By using "somoim" - 수원 스테디 영어스터디, we will have continuous source of Guests to participate Talk matters 
  * We will post online meeting agenda at least 8 hours before the meeting to somoim to join SOTM open kakao chat group for the further notice of the meeting.
