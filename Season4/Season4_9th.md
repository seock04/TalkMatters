## [Conference Topic] 5 principles learning English in six months
> This conference is to invite best speackers from TED video virtually. We'll share the speakers story and try to imitate their speaking. Pronouncing a script and using a sentence expression by our own mouth will be very helpful for learning English. If we can imitate the speakers through practice several times, we can be a great speakers like them also.
* Host: Yong-il Lee

## Invite your speakers
> Pick and share your favorite speacker's story. There are cadidated videos below. You can choose among them or introduce another TED video that you like. I recommend you to choose a short video that is less than 5 minutes long. We will watch the video together and follow the script to read it. You do not need to practice the script in advance, but you are free to learn to speak on your own by following it in advance. These exercises may be done individually over the next week. Next time, we can choose one video longer than 15 minutes and divide it with several members for our practice.
